#هل استخدام Osint غير قانوني؟

لا ، يعد استخدام osint قانونيًا ، ولكن إذا استخدمت المعلومات التي تم الحصول عليها عبر osint لأغراض غير قانونية أو بنوايا خاطئة ، فسيكون ذلك غير قانوني انا ليست مسؤال عن شيئ المستودع لاغراض تعليمية فقط.

سنقوم بإدراج العديد من الأدوات الأخرى في المستقبل في هذا الريبو ، وسأحاول الحفاظ عليها لفترة طويلة وسنستمر في إضافة المزيد والمزيد.
